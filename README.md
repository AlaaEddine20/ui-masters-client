# Work in progress!

This is an ambitious project of mine, i really liked the idea of creating a social-media for developers where they can upload and share their React components so i started to plan the idea and develop it in code with React, React redux. On the server side i have a fully working backend (check "ui-masters-server" repo).

It provides the user with two text editors made with react-code-live library based on react-live library. The two editors are for javascript and CSS codes, if there are errors in the code an error will show up, if the code is correct the component will be renderend in its container.

The main pages are:
  - Add new component => self exlanatory;
  - My profile => The section where the user can edit his infos;
  - Discover => Section where all users components are rendered (like a home page);
  - My components => Where the user can see his uploaded components (soon the edit/delete component feature will be imnplemented).
